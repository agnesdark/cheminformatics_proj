# Cheminformatics_proj

Welcome to my Cheminformatics_proj page! This repository is dedicated to providing Jupyter Notebooks focused on various cheminformatics issues and tasks.

## Repository Overview

In this repository, you'll find a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that cover distinct aspects of cheminformatics. These notebooks document and assist my personal journey in understanding and working with chemical data. They serve as both a learning resource and a practical guide for performing cheminformatics analyses.

## Current Collection

1. ['ChEMBLDownload.ipynb'](https://github.com/agnesdark/cheminformatics_proj/blob/main/ChEMBLDownload.ipynb): This notebook demonstrates how to acquire chemical data from the ChEMBL database and perform basic filtering to prepare the data for further analysis. It covers steps including data retrieval, initial inspection, and simple filtering techniques to curate the dataset.


## Contributions

While this repository primarily documents my learning journey, contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues, suggestions, or pull requests to enhance the notebooks and expand the scope of topics covered.

Happy exploring and analyzing!
